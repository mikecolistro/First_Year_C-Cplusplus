strchr checks a string to see if a character is lo


cated in the string


const char string1 = "This is a test";
char character 1 = 'a';
char character 2 = 'z';

	if(strchr(string1,character1) != Null)
		printf("The char %c was found in the string %s", character1, string1);



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Looking for 's' charactger in "this is a sample string"
found at 4
found at 7
found at 11
found at 18


#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(){
	char str[] = "This is a sample string";
	char *pch;

	printf("Looking for 's' character in \'%s'\'...\n", str);
	pch = strchr(str,'s');
	
	while(pch!= NULL){
		printf("found at %d \n", pch - str + 1);
		pch = strchr(pch + 1, 's');
	}
}

strrchr gets the remainding string that starts with the character so if the character you were looking for was the letter z in the string zebras,
zebras would be returned
